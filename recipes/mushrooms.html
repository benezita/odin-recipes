    <p>A deliciously savory stuffed mushrooms recipe that uses cream cheese â€” a classic appetizer with 
        a kick and always a party favorite when we make them! I usually double the recipe.</p>

    <p><h3>INGREDIENTS</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>12 whole fresh mushrooms, tough ends trimmed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h3>DIRECTIONS</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
        <p>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray.</p>

        <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
        <p>Clean mushrooms with a damp paper towel. Carefully break stems from mushrooms. Finely chop stems and set caps aside</p>

        <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
        <p>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry chopped mushroom stems and garlic in hot oil until any moisture 
            has disappeared, taking care not to burn the garlic, 3 to 5 minutes.</p>

        <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>
        <p>Spread mushroom mixture into a bowl to cool completely, about 10 minutes. Stir cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, black pepper, onion powder, 
            and cayenne pepper into the cooled mushroom mixture until very thick and completely mixed.</p>

        <li><strong>Step 5</strong></li>
        <p>Use a small spoon to fill each mushroom cap with a generous amount of stuffing. Arrange stuffed mushrooms on the prepared cookie sheet.</p>

        <li><strong>Step 6</strong></li>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until piping hot and liquid starts to form under each cap, about 20 minutes.</p>

        <li><strong>Step 7</strong></li>
