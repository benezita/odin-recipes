    <p>Everyone knows there's no salad like a Caprese salad on a hot summer day. F
        resh-picked basil and tomatoes with just a hint of seasoning.</p> <p>I always use a whole spelt loaf when I make this recipe. 
        The notes of the spelt combine perfectly with the light/summery flavors of the other ingredients. <p>Very earthy. 
        Also, fresh ground pepper and chunky sea salt make this dish pop even more. Muah!</p>
