    <h1>Lasagna</h1>

    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously 
        cheesy filling. <p>A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls 
        for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.</p> I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy 
        green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>

    <p><h3>INGREDIENTS</h3></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>
            <li>1/2pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        </ul>

    <p><h3>DIRECTIONS</h3></p>
        <ol>
            <li><p><strong>Step 1</strong></p></li>
        <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>

        <p><img src="../recipes/ingredients.png" alt="all ingredients spot separated"></p>

            <li><p><strong>Step 2</strong></p></li>
        <p>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</p>

            <li><p><strong>Step 3</strong></p></li>
        <p>Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</p>

            <li><p><strong>Step 4</strong></p></li>
        <p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. 
            Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</p>

            <li><p><strong>Step 5</strong></p></li>
            <p>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to 
                the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 
                degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>

            <li><strong>Step 6</strong></li>
            <p>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</p>
