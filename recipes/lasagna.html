    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously 
        cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls 
        for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy 
        green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
